Below is an improved version of the PaymentDashboardPage.js file. This refactored version uses a class based approach with clear, reusable selectors and methods. Each method is focused on a single responsibility, making it easier to maintain and extend. You can further adjust the selectors and URL as needed for your application.

------------------------------------------------------
"use strict";

class PaymentDashboardPage {
  constructor() {
    // Base URL for the payment dashboard page
    this.baseUrl = '/payments-dashboard';

    // Selectors for key elements on the payment dashboard page
    this.selectors = {
      header: '.dashboard-header',                    // Update with the actual header selector
      paymentMethodCard: '[data-test="payment-method-card"]', // Assumed data-test attribute for payment methods
      submitButton: '[data-test="submit-payment"]'     // Assumed data-test attribute for submit button
      // Add other selectors as needed
    };
  }

  /**
   * Navigates to the Payment Dashboard page.
   */
  visit() {
    cy.visit(this.baseUrl);
    return this;
  }

  /**
   * Returns the header element of the dashboard.
   */
  getHeader() {
    return cy.get(this.selectors.header);
  }

  /**
   * Selects a payment method by its name.
   * @param {string} method - The payment method name to select.
   */
  selectPaymentMethod(method) {
    cy.get(this.selectors.paymentMethodCard)
      .contains(method)
      .click();
    return this;
  }

  /**
   * Clicks on the submit button to process the payment.
   */
  submitPayment() {
    cy.get(this.selectors.submitButton).click();
    return this;
  }

  /**
   * Verifies that the Payment Dashboard is displayed.
   */
  verifyDashboardIsDisplayed() {
    this.getHeader().should('be.visible');
    return this;
  }

  // Additional methods (e.g., fill out payment details, check for errors) can be added here
}

export default PaymentDashboardPage;

------------------------------------------------------

In this updated version, note the following improvements:

1. Clear organization of selectors in a single object facilitates maintenance.
2. Each method returns this, allowing method chaining if desired.
3. Detailed JSDoc comments have been added so that future developers can quickly understand each methodâ€™s purpose.
4. The code follows modern JavaScript best practices while being straightforward to update or extend.

You can now import and use PaymentDashboardPage in your Cypress tests to improve code reuse and overall test clarity.
