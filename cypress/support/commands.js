Below is an example of an improved version of the commands.js file. (Note: since no specific code was provided, the example below demonstrates how you might refactor and enhance common custom commands in Cypress using modern JavaScript practices, improved error handling, and logging.)

------------------------------------------------------------
"use strict";

// Custom command to log in a user. Uses modern arrow functions and enhanced error handling.
// You can adjust the API endpoint and storage key as necessary.
Cypress.Commands.add("login", (username, password) => {
  cy.request({
    method: "POST",
    url: "/api/login", // adjust the API endpoint if needed
    body: { username, password },
    failOnStatusCode: false // prevents Cypress from failing the test immediately on non-2xx responses
  })
    .its("body.token")
    .then(token => {
      if (!token) {
        throw new Error("Login failed: Authentication token not found in response.");
      }
      // Save the token in local storage for use by your app during testing.
      window.localStorage.setItem("authToken", token);
      Cypress.log({
        name: "login",
        message: `User ${username} logged in.`
      });
    });
});

// Custom command to log out a user. Clears authentication token from local storage.
// You may extend this command if the backend requires an API call.
Cypress.Commands.add("logout", () => {
  window.localStorage.removeItem("authToken");
  Cypress.log({
    name: "logout",
    message: "User logged out; auth token removed from local storage."
  });
});

// Example of a custom command that selects an element by a data attribute.
// This can help reduce duplication of selectors and improve readability.
Cypress.Commands.add("getByData", (selector, ...args) => {
  // The selector can be something like 'button-submit' and it will be translated to [data-cy="button-submit"]
  return cy.get(`[data-cy="${selector}"]`, ...args);
});

// Optionally, you can add more commands or override existing ones
// For example, an enhanced "click" that logs additional info:
Cypress.Commands.overwrite("click", (originalFn, subject, options) => {
  Cypress.log({
    name: "click",
    message: "Clicked element",
    consoleProps: () => ({
      subject: subject.get(0)
    })
  });
  return originalFn(subject, options);
});

// Expose a method to reset application state if necessary.
Cypress.Commands.add("resetAppState", () => {
  // Example of sending a backend request to reset database state.
  cy.request("POST", "/api/test/reset");
  Cypress.log({
    name: "resetAppState",
    message: "Application state reset."
  });
});

------------------------------------------------------------

Key improvements include:
• Using ES6 arrow functions for conciseness.
• Adding error handling to check for missing tokens.
• Logging meaningful messages with Cypress.log for easier debugging.
• Creating a helper (getByData) to simplify element selection by custom data attributes.
• Overwriting an existing command (click) to maintain logging, demonstrating how you can extend Cypress functionality.

This approach makes your support/commands.js file easier to maintain and your tests more robust. Adjust the API endpoints and local storage keys as per your project’s needs.
