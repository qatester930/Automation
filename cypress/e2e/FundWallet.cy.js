Below is an example of an improved and refactored version of your FundWallet.cy.js file. This version assumes you’re testing the wallet funding flow on your web app, and it uses best practices such as:

• Using beforeEach to centralize repetitive actions (like visiting the page)
• Locating elements via data-test attributes rather than relying solely on classes or tag selectors, which improves test stability
• Adding assertions to confirm that elements are visible before interacting with them
• Keeping the test focused and clear about what it’s verifying

If your original file looks roughly like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------
describe("Fund Wallet", () => {
  it("should allow user to fund their wallet", () => {
    cy.visit("https://example.com");
    cy.get("input[name='amount']").type("100");
    cy.get("button.fund").click();
    cy.contains("Wallet funded successfully").should("be.visible");
  });
});
-------------------------------------------------------------

You might update it to the following improved version:

-------------------------------------------------------------
describe("Fund Wallet", () => {
  // Runs before each test in the block
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Visit the dashboard or home page where the wallet funding component exists
    cy.visit("/");
  });

  it("successfully funds the wallet", () => {
    // Ensure the wallet funding input is visible and type in the amount.
    cy.get("[data-test=amount-input]")
      .should("be.visible")
      .type("100");

    // Click the button to fund the wallet
    cy.get("[data-test=fund-button]")
      .should("be.enabled")
      .click();

    // Confirm the success notification is visible and contains the expected message
    cy.get("[data-test=success-message]")
      .should("be.visible")
      .and("contain", "Wallet funded successfully");
  });
});
-------------------------------------------------------------

Key improvements in this version:

1. Modular Setup: The beforeEach hook avoids code duplication by visiting the required page before each test.
2. Robust Element Selectors: The selectors now use data-test attributes (e.g., data-test=amount-input) which decouple tests from CSS changes.
3. Assertion Enhancements: Added checks (like should("be.visible") and should("be.enabled")) ensure interaction only happens with elements in the expected state.
4. Clear and Self-Documenting: Each test step includes comments clarifying its purpose, which is particularly helpful for maintenance and collaboration.

Feel free to adjust the selectors (data-test attributes) and URL paths as needed to match your application’s actual implementation.
