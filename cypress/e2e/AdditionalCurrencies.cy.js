Below is an improved version of the AdditionalCurrencies.cy.js file. In this version the test suite uses clear naming, consistent arrow functions, and centralized selectors to reduce duplication. It also leverages beforeEach to set the base state and includes comments to clarify each step. (Note: adjust URLs, selectors, and test cases as needed to match your application.)

"use strict";

// Centralized selectors for additional currency features
const SELECTORS = {
  currencySelector: "[data-test='currency-selector']",
  currencyItem: "[data-test='currency-item']",
  selectedCurrency: "[data-test='selected-currency']"
};

describe("Additional Currencies", () => {
  
  // Visit the homepage (or the relevant page) before each test
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit("/"); 
  });

  it("should display the currency selector and at least one currency option", () => {
    // Check that the currency selector exists
    cy.get(SELECTORS.currencySelector).should("exist");

    // Expand the selector if needed (optional step depending on UI logic)
    cy.get(SELECTORS.currencySelector).click();

    // Verify that the list of currencies is not empty
    cy.get(SELECTORS.currencyItem).its("length").should("be.gt", 0);
  });

  it("should allow the user to select an additional currency", () => {
    // Open the currency selector menu
    cy.get(SELECTORS.currencySelector).click();

    // Here, we assume that selecting "EUR" is part of the test.
    // Update the value to match an actual currency label in your app.
    const targetCurrency = "EUR";
    cy.contains(SELECTORS.currencyItem, targetCurrency).click();

    // Verify that the selected currency was updated on the UI.
    cy.get(SELECTORS.selectedCurrency)
      .should("exist")
      .and("contain", targetCurrency);
  });

  // Additional tests for currency functionality can be added here.
  
});

Key improvements and practices included:
• Using a selectors object (SELECTORS) to centralize locating elements. This reduces duplication and eases maintenance if selectors change.
• Utilizing beforeEach to set up a consistent starting point.
• Using clear test descriptions so that the output is easy to read and understand.
• Favoring arrow functions and strict mode for modern JavaScript best practices.

Feel free to adjust the URL (cy.visit("/")) or any of the data-test selectors to fit your exact application context.
