Below is an improved version of the file that follows best practices such as extracting selectors into data attributes, using beforeEach for consistent setup, and clear separation of concerns. Adjust the selectors and expected values as needed for your application:

"use strict";

describe('Additional Currencies Conversion', () => {
  // Visit the homepage (or the page under test) before each test case.
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('/');
  });

  // Define an array of currency objects containing identifiers and expected rates.
  // You can update the expected values to match your real test data.
  const currencies = [
    { id: 'eur', name: 'EUR', expectedRate: '0.85' },
    { id: 'gbp', name: 'GBP', expectedRate: '0.75' },
    { id: 'jpy', name: 'JPY', expectedRate: '110' }
  ];

  // Verify that each additional currency displays correctly.
  currencies.forEach(currency => {
    it(`should display the correct conversion rate for ${currency.name}`, () => {
      // Use data-cy attributes for selecting elements.
      cy.get(`[data-cy=currency-${currency.id}]`).should('exist').and('be.visible');

      // Check that the conversion rate is correct.
      cy.get(`[data-cy=currency-${currency.id}] .rate`)
        .invoke('text')
        .then(text => {
          // Trim any extra whitespace and compare the text to the expected value.
          expect(text.trim()).to.eq(currency.expectedRate);
        });
    });
  });

  // Test that refreshing the page updates the conversion rates.
  it('should update conversion rates when the refresh button is clicked', () => {
    // Click the refresh button using its data-cy attribute.
    cy.get('[data-cy=refresh-button]').click();

    // If necessary, wait for the UI to refresh. Adjust the waiting strategy according to your app's behavior.
    cy.wait(500);

    // Validate that each currency rate is updated correctly.
    currencies.forEach(currency => {
      cy.get(`[data-cy=currency-${currency.id}] .rate`)
        .invoke('text')
        .then(text => {
          // Optionally, parse the rate and ensure it is a valid number greater than zero.
          const rate = parseFloat(text.trim());
          expect(rate).to.be.a("number");
          expect(rate).to.be.greaterThan(0);
        });
    });
  });
});

A few additional tips:

1. Use data attributes (like data-cy) for selectors so that your tests remain resilient to UI changes.
2. Adjust the cy.wait() duration or replace it with more robust waiting (e.g., intercepting API calls) if needed.
3. If you have common actions across tests (like refreshing rates), consider creating custom Cypress commands.
4. Organize your test data (currencies in this case) so that updating expected values requires changes in just one location.

This improved code should help maintain readability, scalability, and stability over time.
