Below is one example of how you might refactor and improve your WalletDashboard.cy.js file. In this version, we extract URL and element selectors into constants, leverage beforeEach for shared setup, and write clear, modular tests. (Note that without the original file it’s hard to be exact; adjust the selectors and URL as needed for your application.)

--------------------------------------------------------------
"use strict";

const WALLET_URL = "/wallet";

// Element selectors using data attributes for a more robust approach
const SELECTORS = {
  balance: "[data-cy='wallet-balance']",
  copyAddressButton: "[data-cy='copy-address']",
  alertMessage: "[data-cy='alert-message']"
};

describe("Wallet Dashboard", () => {
  
  // Runs once before all tests in the block
  before(() => {
    // If your application requires any authentication or state initialization, do it here.
    // For example:
    // cy.login(); 
  });
  
  // Runs before each test case to ensure a fresh state
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit(WALLET_URL);
  });
  
  it("displays the wallet balance", () => {
    // Validate that the balance element is visible and contains a valid dollar amount.
    cy.get(SELECTORS.balance)
      .should("be.visible")
      .invoke("text")
      .then((balanceText) => {
        // Adjust the regex based on what a valid balance should look like
        expect(balanceText.trim()).to.match(/^\$/);
      });
  });
  
  it("allows the user to copy the wallet address", () => {
    // Click the copy address button
    cy.get(SELECTORS.copyAddressButton).should("be.visible").click();
    
    // Validate that an alert is displayed with copy confirmation
    cy.get(SELECTORS.alertMessage)
      .should("be.visible")
      .and("contain", "Copied");
    
    // Optionally, if your application has clipboard access support, you can verify 
    // that the clipboard contains the expected address:
    // cy.window().its('navigator.clipboard').invoke('readText').should('equal', expectedAddress);
  });
  
  // Add more tests as needed, for example error handling or other dashboard interactions
  
});
--------------------------------------------------------------

Key improvements in this version include:

1. Using constants to manage URLs and selectors. This makes the tests easier to maintain if these values change.
2. Employing data-cy (or similar data attribute) selectors rather than relying solely on classes or IDs. This approach makes the tests less brittle.
3. Structuring the tests with clear before, beforeEach, and describe blocks so that setup and teardown logic is organized.
4. Including inline comments to guide future developers through what each section is doing.

Adjust the selectors, URLs, and any additional setup (like authentication) to fit your application’s requirements.
